SSL Handshake: Asymmetric encryption uses public/private key

-	Client sends a “client hello” message. This includes client’s ssl version number, cipher settings, session specific data and other info which server needs to communicate with client using ssl
-	Server responds with “server hello” message. This includes server’s ssl version number, cipher settings, session specific data, an SSL cert with a public key to client
-	Client verifies server’s SSL cert from CA and authenticates server. If authentication succeeds , then next step, else error
-	Client creates session key and encrypt with public key and sends to server.
-	Server decrypts session key with its private key and sends acknowledgement to client encrypted with session key

Data Transfer:
Client and server now use above session key to encrypt/decrypt data (symmetric encryption)
